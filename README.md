# Topic Solitaire

A strategic card game where you organize cards by matching them to their topics. Think solitaire meets categorization.

## What's the Game?

You get a deck of cards with different items such as "Tulip", "Volkswagen", or "Asteroid" and topic cards such as "Cars", "Flowers", or "Space". Your job is to figure out which items belong to which topics and organize them all before you run out of moves.

## How to Play

**The Strategy:**

- Topic cards (with the little crown & gold border) go in the top row
- Regular cards get matched to their topics
- Draw wisely - make sure to pay attention to which cards are drawn
- When the bottom card piles are empty, you can refresh the field with new cards
